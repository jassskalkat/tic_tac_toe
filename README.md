# tic_tac_toe
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. 
A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. 
This program simulates the real tic-tac-toe game. Two players fight against either other and use their strategies to win.
